1. Decide what to order for dinner.
2. Everyone agrees on PIZZA!! YUM!!
3. Get out the menus and decide which pizza shop to order from.
4. After some negotiating, we have decided on La Piazza.
5. Everyone reviews the menu and Sage writes down the orders.
6. Mom calls La Piazza to place the order.
7. La Piazza answeres and tells mom they now offer online ordering.
8. Mom hangs up and pulls La Piazza's website.
9. Mom is technologically challenged, so she has the kids helps place the order.
10. The order is placed and delivery is chosen.
11. We wait for the delivery...
12. Ahhh, fresh hot pizza arrives!
13. Enjoy!
14. Well, we got the wrong order and didn't notice until after the drive left.
15. So, do we eat what someone else ordered or call La Piazza back?
16. The family decided to:
17. a) call the restaurant to let them know so don't give another customer an incorrect order.
18. b) try the food that was delivered, it's an adventure!
19. We all tried things we've never had before and it was all GREAT!
20. We found some new favorites and La Piazza was kind enough to refund what we paid.
21. Moral of the story:
22. Mistakes happen, embrace them and enjoy life (and pizza)
